      <title>Power and Polynomial functions</title>
      
      <p>Up next are power and polynomial functions. Consider something like
	  <m>y = f(x) = mx+b</m>, but instead drop the "<m>+b</m>" and consider
	  changing the exponent on the variable <m>x</m>. What's left turns into
	  something like <me>y = g(x) = mx^{n}</me>.</p>

	  <p>For something like <m>m=1</m> and <m>n=1</m> we have the line
	  <m>y = g(x) = x</m>. The graph is a straight line on standard
	  Cartesian coordinates, tilted upward from left to right at a
	  <m>45^{\circ}</m> angle. For powers like <m>n=2</m> or <m>n=3</m>,
	  we have power functions representing the leading terms of
	  quadratic or cubic functions. For somewhat unusal powers of 
	  <m>0 \le n \le 1</m>, like <m>n = \frac{1}{2}</m> or <m>n = \frac{1}{3}</m> 
	  we have power functions like the square root or cube root, respectively.</p>
	  
	  <p>When using square roots, you may be more familiar writing
	  <m>\sqrt{x}</m>, but we can write <m>g(x) = x^{\frac{1}{2}} =
	  \sqrt{x}</m>. Similarly for the cube root <m>\sqrt[3]{x} =
	  x^{\frac{1}{3}}</m>. So, in addition to the squaring and cubing
	  functions, the functions square root and cube root (and all of the
	  others) are examples of power functions.</p>
