<title>Exponential and Logarithmic functions</title>

After introducing the linear functions, power functions, and polynomial functions, we can address exponential and logarithmic functions These two panic-inducing functions are probably among the most used in calculations in the lab sciences Consider the following curve
We can contrast the form of power functions and exponential functions and try to build some intuition
Which of the following are exponential functions?  
<ul>
<li><p><m>f(x)=x2</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>f(x)=ex </m></p></li>
<li><p><m>f(x)=10x </m></p></li>
<li><p><m>f(x)=xe</m></p></li>
</ul>

Also helpful are the following rules that work for real numbers <m>a, n, m</m>

<ul>
<li><p><m> an  am =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> (an)m =  am =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>an am =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> a0 =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> a1 =</m></p></li>
</ul>

These rules also work when the base is a variable like x or the base of an exponential function
like e Likewise we can have expressions involving variables in exponents
Caution: We do not have rules for things like <m>am + an</m> (or, assuming a and b are different, an  bm)
Before getting into too many problems that use exponentials, we should review the logarithm - it is necessary for some, but not all problems involving exponentials (See separate page)
These functions are inverses, so
This is helpful for solving equations involving exponential functions
<me>eln(x) = x and ln(ex) = x</me>


Before getting to that, what are logarithms? Logarithms often show up when we need to systemat- ically (and reversibly) manipulate formulas or data For example, we can use the base-10 logarithm below, as we might in a spreadsheet
x y
1/4 1/2 11 93
25 5 49 7
log10(x)
log10(x)

What just happened?
To introduce the logarithm as the inverse function to an exponential function, it is helpful to think of powers of ten Consider how we express large numbers in scientific notation,
1, 000, 000 = 106
To write one million, we multiply   factors of  raised to the power
 We say,
gives ,

or, symbolically
Logarithms are powers!
log10(1, 000, 000) =
Using your calculator find each of the following  log10(1) =
 log10(e) =  ln(1) =
 ln(1/2) =
 ln(2) =  ln(e) =

Just like for exponents (and exponential functions) we had a list of rules, we also have commonly- used algebraic rules for manipulating logarithm functions These work whether or not we consider the logarithm to be base-e or base-10, or any other base Since we will most often use the natural logarithm, <m>\ln(x)</m>, we will write the rules that way The following rules work for real numbers <m>a, b, n</m>
<ul>
<li><p><m> \ln(ab) =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>  \ln(an) =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>  \ln\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>  \ln(a/b)</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>  \ln(1) =</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>  \ln(e) =</m></p></li>
</ul>
Common applications of exponentials involve solving equations that arise in chemistry, microbi- ology, or population growth Suppose the function <m>p(t) = 362e0012t</m> describes the population of some organism as a function of time measured in weeks
 What is the initial population size?
 What is the population size after six weeks?
 When has the population reached twice its initial population size?
Suppose that the amount of radioactivity that remains from an injected medical tracer is described
by <m>r(t) = 15e0027t</m>, where <m>t</m> is in hours
 What is the initial amount of radioactivity?
 How much radioactivity remains when it has reached half of the initial amount?
 When has the radioactivity reached half its initial amount?

<title>Log-transforming equations</title> 
<statement><p>An important application of logarithms, related to graphing, was hinted at in the table a few pages
back The data from the ordered pairs are just a few nice points from the graph of <m>f(x) = </m>
That doesnt seem like it has much to do with anything, but remember we can write <m>y = f(x) = x2 </m> Lets take logarithms of both sides and see what happens As long as were careful, it doesnt really matter which logarithm we use, but we will use the base-10 logarithm for consistency with our earlier example
Historically (and still even today) scientists have been obsessed with graphing straight lines
