<title>Exponential and Logarithmic functions</title>

		<p>
			After introducing the linear functions, power functions, and polynomial functions, we can address exponential and logarithmic functions. These two panic-inducing functions are probably among the most used in calculations in the lab sciences. Consider the following curve.
		</p>
<p>INSERT GRAPH</p>
		<p>
			We can contrast the form of power functions and exponential functions and try to build some intuition.
		</p>

		<p>
			Which of the following are exponential functions?
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p><m>f(x) = x^2</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>f(x) = e^x</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>f(x) = 10^x</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>f(x) = x^e</m></p></li>

		</ul></p>

		<p>
			Also helpful are the following rules that work for real numbers <m>a, n, m</m>.
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p><m>a^n\cdot a^m =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>(a^n)^m =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>a^{-m} =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\dfrac{a^n}{a^m} =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>a^0 =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>a^1 =</m></p></li>

		</ul></p>

		<p>
			These rules also work when the base is a variable like <m>x</m> or the base of an exponential function like <m>e</m>. Likewise we can have expressions involving variables in exponents.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Caution:</em> We do not have rules for things like <m>a^m + a^n</m> (or, assuming <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are different, <m>a^n\cdot b^m</m>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Before getting into too many problems that use exponentials, we should review the logarithm - it is necessary for <em>some, but not all</em> problems involving exponentials. (See separate page.)
		</p>

		<p>
			These functions are inverses, so <me>e^{\ln(x)} = x \text{ and } \ln(e^x) = x.</me> This is helpful for solving equations involving exponential functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before getting to that, what are logarithms? Logarithms often show up when we need to systematically (and reversibly) manipulate formulas or data. For example, we can use the base-10 logarithm below, as we might in a spreadsheet.

			To introduce the logarithm as the inverse function to an exponential function, it is helpful to think of powers of ten. Consider how we express large numbers in scientific notation, <me>1,000,000 = 10^6</me> To write one million, we multiply  factors of . We say,
		</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
		<p>
			<q> raised to the power  gives  ,</q>
		</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

		<p>
			or, symbolically <me>\log_{10}(1,000,000)=\underline{\hspace{1cm}}.</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Using your calculator find each of the following
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p><m>\log_{10}(1) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\log_{10}(e) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(1) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(1/2) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(2) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(e) =</m></p></li>

		</ul></p>

		<p>
			Just like for exponents (and exponential functions) we had a list of rules, we also have commonly-used algebraic rules for manipulating logarithm functions. These work whether or not we consider the logarithm to be base-<m>e</m> or base-<m>10</m>, or any other base. Since we will most often use the natural logarithm, <m>\ln(x)</m>, we will write the rules that way. The following rules work for real numbers <m>a, b, n</m>.
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p><m>\ln(ab) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(a^n) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln\left(\frac{1}{b}\right) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(1) =</m></p></li>
	<li><p><m>\ln(e) =</m></p></li>

		</ul></p>

		<p>
			Common applications of exponentials involve solving equations that arise in chemistry, microbiology, or population growth. Suppose the function <m>p(t) = 36.2e^{0.012t}</m> describes the population of some organism as a function of time measured in weeks.
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p>What is the initial population size?</p></li>
	<li><p>What is the population size after six weeks?</p></li>
	<li><p>When has the population reached twice its initial population size?</p></li>

		</ul></p>

		<p>
			Suppose that the amount of radioactivity that remains from an injected medical tracer is described by <m>r(t) = 15e^{-0.027t}</m>, where <m>t</m> is in hours.
		</p>

		<p><ul>	<li><p>What is the initial amount of radioactivity?</p></li>
	<li><p>How much radioactivity remains when it has reached half of the initial amount?</p></li>
	<li><p>When has the radioactivity reached half its initial amount?</p></li>

		</ul></p>

			An important application of logarithms, related to graphing, was hinted at in the table a few pages back. The data from the ordered pairs are just a few <q>nice</q> points from the graph of <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>. That doesn’t seem like it has much to do with anything, but remember we can write <m>y = f(x) = x^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>. Let’s take logarithms of both sides and see what happens. <em>As long as we’re careful</em>, it doesn’t really matter which logarithm we use, but we will use the base-10 logarithm for consistency with our earlier example.

			Historically (and still even today) scientists have been obsessed with graphing straight lines.
