        <title>Power and polynomial functions</title>


		<p>
			Up next are power and polynomial functions. Consider something like <m>y = f(x) = mx+b</m>, whose <em>form</em> is given by,
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, drop the <q><m>+b</m></q> and consider changing the exponent on the variable <m>x</m> to something other than one. What’s left turns into something like,
		</p>

		<p>
			For powers like <m>n=2</m> or <m>n=3</m>, we have power functions representing the leading terms of quadratic or cubic functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			For somewhat unusual powers of <m>0 \le n \le 1</m>, like <m>n = \frac{1}{2}</m> or <m>n = \frac{1}{3}</m> we have power functions like the square root or cube root, respectively. When using square roots, you may be more familiar with writing <m>\sqrt{x}</m>, but we can write <m>g(x) =
      \sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>. Similarly for the cube root <m>\sqrt[3]{x} =
      x^{\frac{1}{3}}</m>. The root and fractional power are interchangeable, and the fractional powers are <em>essential</em> when doing calculus!
		</p>

		<p>
			So, in addition to the squaring and cubing functions, the functions square root and cube root (and all of the others) are examples of power functions
		</p>

		<p>
			You might encounter power functions in a variety of circumstances as models for physical phenomenon. For example, <me>K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</me> describes the kinetic energy, <m>K</m>, for an object of mass <m>m</m> kilograms moving with velocity <m>v</m> meters per second. Treating <m>m</m> as a constant (for simplicity set <m>m = 1</m>), we can look at the relationship between <m>K</m> and <m>v</m> with a graph. What happens to the graph as we change <m>m</m>?
		</p>

		<p>
			A related question that you might encounter in physics asks you to solve for <m>v</m> as a function of <m>K</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The formulas we encounter in many circumstances (lab, life, work) involve linear functions or quadratic or cubic power functions. The cross sectional area of a tree trunk (or any cylinder) is given by <m>A = \pi r^2</m>. Since area depends on radius, let’s write it as a function <m>A = A(r) = \pi r^2</m>. Find the following,
		</p>

		<p><ol>	<li><p>Find the area if the radius is <m>3~\text{cm}</m>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Find the area if the radius is doubled<fn>		<p>

		</p></fn></p></li>
	<li><p>Write a sentence that relates all four quantities.</p></li>

		</ol></p>

		<p>
			The volume of a spherical cell is given by <m>V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>. Since volume depends on radius, let’s write it as a function <m>V = V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>. Find the following,
		</p>

		<p><ol>	<li><p>Find the volume of a prokaryotic cell with a radius of <m>5.0~\mu\text{m}</m>. <em>Hint: this is a radius of <m>0.0005~\text{cm}</m> or <m>5.0\times10^{-4}~\text{cm}</m>.</em></p></li>
	<li><p>Eukaryotic cells can be much larger than prokaryotic cells. Find the volume of a eukaryotic cell with a radius of <m>50.0~\mu\text{m}</m>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Write a sentence that relates all four quantities.</p></li>

		</ol></p>

		<p>
			Sometimes we encounter power functions with power, <m>p</m>, that is a number between 0 and 1, for example, when describing how some body measurement changes as a function of body size. In particular we look for relationships of the form <me>(\text{output measurement}) = (\text{constant})(\text{input measurement})^\text{constant}.</me> A famous example relates a measure of metabolic rate, <m>r</m>, to body mass, <m>m</m>, using <m>r = am^p</m>, for numbers <m>a</m> and <m>p</m>. These are numbers that can be estimated from data to give a formula such as <m>r = 0.06m^{0.77}</m>. Of most interest, and significant historical debate, is that <m>p \approx 0.75</m> for most mammals.
		</p>

		<p>
			Occasionally we need functions built by adding or subtracting multiple power function terms with different powers. When the powers are all nonnegative whole numbers, we call the result a polynomial. For example, we might need an <m>n^{\text{th}}</m>-degree polynomial, which can be written, <me>\begin{aligned}
p_n(x) &amp;= \sum_{k = 0}^n a_kx^k\\
 &amp;= a_0x^0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n\\
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>

			As a concrete example, here is an equation you might see in physics which describes the motion of an object in free fall, where <m>s = s(t)</m> is height in meters and <m>t</m> is time in seconds, <me>s(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 5.</me> In certain applications we are interested in describing the population growth rate, <m>g</m>, of an organism (e.g., the amount of animals produced over a given amount of time), as a function of the population size of that organism <m>N</m>. We might graph <me>g = g(N) = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right),</me> where <m>r</m> and <m>K</m> are biologically-important numbers. Typically <m>r</m> is pretty small and <m>K</m> is pretty big. If it helps, we can pick <m>r = 0.1</m> and <m>K=100</m>, but let’s forge ahead first and just remember that these two letters represent numbers. If we get stuck, we can plug in these specific values and graph using a calculator<fn>		<p>
			Don’t worry, we are almost done introducing big formulas with so many letters! But, I do think it’s important to see here because that is how they often appear elsewhere.
